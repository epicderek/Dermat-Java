/**
 * A dermatj.utils.seq.container.map.DuoMap is a parallel-access hashed Map whose collection of 
 * values must be a unique set with no duplicate elements that enables lookup and modification
 * of entries in constant time from both the key to the value and the value to the key. One such
 * Map is implemented by holding two HashMaps with mappings in both directions. Therefore, both the 
 * types of the key and the value must be capable of being readily hashed, with their hashCode() methods
 * effectively overridden. Whenever an insertion of an entry whose value is a duplicate to those 
 * entries presently contained in this DuoMap with different keys to that of this entry, 
 * a dermatj.utils.excs.Exceptions.DuplicateValueException is thrown. This exception is a RuntimeException, 
 * and can therefore be ignored if handling if unnecessary or can be attributed to a programming error.
